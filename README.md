Publishing for testing !
PLEASE PULL FIRST TO UPDATE WITH THE ORIGIN

`git pull`\
Idk if you're supposed to do this but add and commit again just to be safe.

Push to origin

`git push`\
If there's any errors here, just do what the terminal tells you to do.

Open up the repo in your browser and make a new pull request to the dev branch.

Resolve any conflicts and merge

Should be good to test from here :)

Getting back into coding
Make sure you're on your own branch

`git checkout ingrid`\
Pull to make sure you're up to date

`git pull`\
I think you might also want to get onto the online repo and merge from master or master (up to you what version you'd like to work on)

Now code away !

Committing to master
If you're pretty confident your code is working, do all the steps as before, but now submit a pull request to master.
